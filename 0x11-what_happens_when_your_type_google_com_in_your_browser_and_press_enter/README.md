## What Happens When You Type a URL in Your Browser: The Journey of a Web Request to Google.com

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, the following steps occur:

1. DNS request: Your browser sends a Domain Name System (DNS) request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name www.google.com to an IP address.

2. TCP/IP: Your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection with the IP address returned by the DNS server.

3. Firewall: If there is a firewall between your computer and the web server, the firewall will verify that the request is permitted and will allow the connection to proceed.

4. HTTPS/SSL: If the website uses HTTPS (HTTP Secure), your browser and the web server will perform a SSL/TLS handshake to establish a secure encrypted connection.

5. Load-balancer: If there are multiple web servers that can handle the request, a load-balancer will distribute the request to an available web server to ensure that the workload is distributed evenly.

6. Web server: The web server receives the request from your browser and generates an HTTP response.

7. Application server: If the website requires dynamic content, such as a search query or a user login, the request is forwarded to an application server that can handle the request.

8. Database: If the requested content is stored in a database, the application server queries the database for the requested data.

9. HTTP response: Once the web server generates the HTTP response, it is sent back to your browser through the same TCP/IP connection that was established in step 2.

10. Rendering: Your browser then renders the received response into a visual display that you can interact with, allowing you to browse the website.

Understanding the journey of a web request is an essential part of understanding how the internet works. From DNS requests to database queries, each step in the process is crucial to delivering a fast, secure, and interactive browsing experience. The next time you enter a URL into your browser, take a moment to appreciate the intricate journey your web request takes to deliver the content youâ€™re looking for.
